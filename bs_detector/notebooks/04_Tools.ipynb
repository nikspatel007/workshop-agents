    "- **Multi-Agent System** with specialized experts\n",
    "- **Smart Tool Assignment** - only Current Events Expert has web search\n",
    "- **Efficient Routing** - claims go to the right expert\n",
    "- **Tool-calling LLM** - expert decides when to search\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture Evolution\n",
    "1. **Module 1**: Simple BS detector\n",
    "2. **Module 2**: Added LangGraph for reliability  \n",
    "3. **Module 3**: Multi-agent routing to specialists\n",
    "4. **Module 4**: Tools for the expert who needs them!\n",

    "    technical_expert_node,\n",
    "    historical_expert_node,\n",

    "    # Expert decides when to search\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Architecture Works\n",
    "1. **Separation of Concerns**\n",
    "   - Router focuses on classification\n",
    "   - Experts focus on their domains\n",
    "   - Tools only where needed\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**\n",
    "   - Historical/Technical claims: Fast, no search needed\n",
    "   - Current events: Search when necessary\n",
    "   - No wasted API calls\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Maintainability**\n",
    "   - Easy to add new experts\n",
    "   - Easy to add tools to specific experts\n",
    "   - Clear responsibility boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "In Iteration 5, we could add:\n",
    "- More specialized tools (fact databases, calculators)\n",
    "- Human-in-the-loop for low confidence\n",
    "- Multi-expert consensus for complex claims"

    "- **Tool-calling LLM agent** that decides when it needs more information\n",
    "- **Information sufficiency-based decisions** - not keyword matching\n",
    "- **Proper tool binding pattern** using LangChain's @tool decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Implementation Details\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Define tool with clear documentation\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Approach Works\n",
    "1. **LLM Agency > Hardcoded Rules**\n",
    "   - Adapts to context naturally\n",
    "   - No brittle keyword matching\n",
    "   - Handles edge cases intelligently\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tool Documentation Matters**\n",
    "   - Clear docstrings guide the LLM\n",
    "   - Explains WHEN to use the tool\n",
    "   - Self-documenting code\n",

    "3. **Information Sufficiency Focus**\n",
