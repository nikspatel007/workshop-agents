# Iteration 3: Adding Evaluation with DeepEval

## Overview
In this iteration, we add systematic evaluation capabilities to our BS detector using DeepEval. This allows us to measure improvements quantitatively and ensure our enhancements actually work.

## What We Build
- Comprehensive evaluation framework using DeepEval
- Custom metrics for BS detection accuracy
- Aviation claims dataset with 30 test cases
- Performance comparison across iterations

## Key Learning Objectives
1. **LLM Evaluation Best Practices**
   - Why evaluation matters in agent development
   - Creating representative test datasets
   - Balancing accuracy, confidence, and reasoning quality

2. **DeepEval Framework**
   - Custom metrics for domain-specific tasks
   - Test case management
   - Performance tracking

3. **Data-Driven Development**
   - Measuring improvements empirically
   - Understanding failure modes
   - Iterative refinement based on metrics

## Core Components

### 1. Aviation Claims Dataset
- 30 claims across difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
- Categories: historical, technical, safety, performance, future, misleading
- Each claim includes:
  - Ground truth verdict
  - Expected confidence level
  - Explanation for learning

### 2. Custom DeepEval Metrics
```python
# BS Detection Accuracy - exact match required
class BSDetectionAccuracy(BaseMetric):
    def measure(self, test_case: LLMTestCase) -> float

# Confidence Calibration - confidence should match correctness
class ConfidenceCalibration(BaseMetric):
    def measure(self, test_case: LLMTestCase) -> float

# Reasoning Quality - LLM evaluates explanation quality
class ReasoningQuality(BaseMetric):
    def measure(self, test_case: LLMTestCase) -> float
```

### 3. Evaluation Framework
```python
class BSDetectorEvaluator:
    def evaluate_detector(detector_func, iteration_name) -> EvaluationResult
    def run_deepeval_tests(detector_func, iteration_name)
    def compare_iterations()
```

## How It Works

1. **Load Test Dataset**
   - 30 aviation claims with varying difficulty
   - Ground truth labels for accuracy measurement

2. **Run Evaluation**
   - Test both baseline and LangGraph detectors
   - Measure accuracy, confidence calibration, response time
   - Break down results by difficulty and category

3. **Compare Results**
   - See if LangGraph improved over baseline
   - Identify strengths and weaknesses
   - Guide future improvements

## Key Insights

### Evaluation Results Structure
```python
class EvaluationResult(BaseModel):
    iteration: str
    total_claims: int
    accuracy: float
    
    # Breakdown by difficulty
    easy_accuracy: float
    medium_accuracy: float
    hard_accuracy: float
    
    # Confidence analysis
    avg_confidence: float
    avg_confidence_when_correct: float
    avg_confidence_when_wrong: float
    
    # Performance
    avg_response_time: float
```

### Expected Improvements
- LangGraph version should show:
  - Similar or better accuracy
  - More stable performance (retry logic)
  - Better confidence calibration
  - Consistent response times

## Running the Evaluation

### Quick Test (Easy Claims Only)
```python
from modules.m3_evaluation import BSDetectorEvaluator, evaluate_baseline

evaluator = BSDetectorEvaluator()
evaluator.evaluate_detector(check_claim, "Baseline", subset="easy")
```

### Full Evaluation
```python
from modules.m3_evaluation import compare_all_iterations

# Runs full comparison between iterations
compare_all_iterations()
```

### DeepEval Tests
```python
evaluator.run_deepeval_tests(check_claim_with_graph, "LangGraph")
```

## Success Criteria
1. ✅ Evaluation framework runs successfully
2. ✅ Can measure accuracy across difficulty levels
3. ✅ DeepEval custom metrics work properly
4. ✅ Clear comparison between iterations
5. ✅ Actionable insights for improvement

## Time Estimate
- **Review previous work**: 2 minutes
- **Understand evaluation concepts**: 5 minutes
- **Run evaluations**: 5 minutes
- **Analyze results**: 3 minutes
- **Total**: 15 minutes

## Next Steps
After completing this iteration, you'll have:
- Quantitative metrics for your BS detector
- Understanding of evaluation best practices
- Foundation for measuring future improvements
- Ready for Iteration 4: Tool Integration

## Common Issues
1. **API Rate Limits**: Evaluation runs many LLM calls
   - Solution: Use subset evaluation for testing
   
2. **Inconsistent Results**: LLMs can be non-deterministic
   - Solution: Run multiple times, look at averages
   
3. **High Cost**: Full evaluation can be expensive
   - Solution: Start with small subsets

## Key Takeaway
"You can't improve what you don't measure" - evaluation is crucial for building reliable AI agents!
